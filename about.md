I am a PhD student in the [Maxwell Institute Graduate School of Analysis and its Applications](http://www.maxwell.ac.uk/migsaa) (MIGSAA), formed by the Universities of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt. This has now been superseded by the [MAC-MIGS](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/) CDT.

I am supervised by [Michela Ottobre](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mo3/) and [Kevin Painter](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~painter/), working on invariant measures of interacting particle systems, both analytically and numerically.

This website is a place to document my academic work, as well as place to put other projects I've been working on. It is, along with most of my projects, a work in progress.
