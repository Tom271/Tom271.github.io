It's that time of year again for PhD students across the land to write their end of year reports, and I am no different. This year I've written primarily in LaTeX, as well as in [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). This allows for a more interactive experience, and in particular for my to put animations within the report to aid explanation.

It's [available online](https://tom271.github.io/InteractingParticleSystems/).

I'd highly recommend Bookdown for writing up any work. The only drawback for me is the lack of references within figure captions. This was the only LaTeX feature I wasn't able to emulate---other than that it is much better: embedded code, automatic figures, support for Python, Julia, etc. The ability to export either as html or pdf (through [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)) is incredible!
