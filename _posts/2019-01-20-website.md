title: Creating a Webpage
feature-img: "./assets/img/sticks.jpg"

This webpage has been created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby-based website platform using the [Type](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme) theme. All the details of how to create your own are in the readme of the link above. I'll add to this things that aren't in the readme that I've used that come from the Jekyll docs or elsewhere.
