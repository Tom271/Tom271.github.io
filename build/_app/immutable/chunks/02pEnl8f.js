Serendipitously, work has just taken an order of <a href="https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth" rel="nofollow">AudioMoths</a>, a bioacoustic device designed for recording bird and bat sound. The cogs started whirring. Bird presence is the output variable, but what can I do? I also (unrelated) just took an order of 10kg of bird seed. Sounds like as good of an input as any. Thus began the “Big Bird Seed Experiment”<!>.</p> <p>This project will be split over multiple posts, as I develop each part. The broad plan is:</p> <ol><li>Detection: configuring bioacoustic sensors, hardware and software.</li> <li>Experimental Design: planning the experiment, cause and effect, causal inference, ethics.</li> <li>Collection: doing the thing, measuring feed and birds.</li> <li>Analysis: can we answer any of our questions from Part 2? Causal inference, Bayesian and frequentist statistics.</li> <li>Reflection: what now, what next and why.</li></ol> <p>I’ll be sharing as I go in a “digital garden” type approach. Follow at your own risk.</p> <p>[2]</p>',1);function J(n){var t=q(),o=w(t),e=r(s(o),3);g(e,{note:"A rarity for a rewilder, you might assume."});var a=r(e,4);g(a,{note:"That's a big bird-seed experiment, not a big-bird seed experiment"}),u(),l(o),u(8),v(n,t)}export{J as default,S as metadata};
