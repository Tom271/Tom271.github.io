I've recently been reading [The Book of Why](https://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) by Pearl and Mackenzie. This has made me want to design my own causal experiment, something where I can make an intervention <Footnote note="A rarity for a rewilder, you might assume."></Footnote> and measure the impact. Serendipitously, work has just taken an order of [AudioMoths](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth), a bioacoustic device designed for recording bird and bat sound. The cogs started whirring. Bird presence is the output variable, but what can I do? I also (unrelated) just took an order of 10kg of bird seed. Sounds like as good of an input as any. Thus began the "Big Bird Seed Experiment"<Footnote note="That's a big bird-seed experiment, not a big-bird seed experiment"></Footnote>.

This project will be split over multiple posts, as I develop each part. The broad plan is:

1. Detection: configuring bioacoustic sensors, hardware and software.
2. Experimental Design: planning the experiment, cause and effect, causal inference, ethics.
3. Collection: doing the thing, measuring feed and birds.
4. Analysis: can we answer any of our questions from Part 2? Causal inference, Bayesian and frequentist statistics.
5. Reflection: what now, what next and why.

I'll be sharing as I go in a "digital garden" type approach. Follow at your own risk.
